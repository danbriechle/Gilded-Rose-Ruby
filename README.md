# This is my first pass at the guilded rose kata, I have spent about 2 hours refectoring as practice for a tech challenge. 
## TODO 
- The tick method needs to be further refactored. In keeping with SRP create a Klass helper method and remove the case statement. 
- Def init can initialize the object with the klass statement 
- Other logic can be broken out into helpers
